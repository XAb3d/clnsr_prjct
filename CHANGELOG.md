## 2026-07-28

### Added — GHA (Ghana Card) cross-record conflict check
If the same `CustomerID` is linked to two different **GHA-format** national ID
values across records, this is now flagged as an identity conflict — regardless
of which of the 7 ID columns (`NatIDNum`, `VotersIDNum`, `DriverLicNum`,
`PassportNum`, `SSNum`, `EzwichNum`, `OtherIDNum`) each value happens to be filed
under. Only GHA-prefixed IDs trigger this (not other 3-letter country codes like
NGA/CIV), since the Ghana Card is the one ID type guaranteed unique per person.

Both the shared `CustomerID` cell and each record's own conflicting ID field are
flagged, routing the record to UNL with a clear message.

*Files:* `Home.razor` (`RunAllCrossRecordChecksIND`, new check #15),
`IndividualContext.cs` (new `SameCustomerIDDifferentGhanaCard` flag).

### Added — On-demand Unloadable Log (Individual/IND only)
After cleaning an IND file, an associate can now generate the unloadable log's
header row plus Demographic/Financial rejection breakdown tables for that run,
via a new panel on the CLEANING view (appears only when the run produced UNL
records).

- **New `SubscriberProfile` table** (EF Core entity + migration) — a one-time
  Subscriber Name / Institution Type lookup keyed by subscriber code, since the
  external `[Subscriber].[Subscribers]` table doesn't carry those fields. Filled
  in once per subscriber, reused automatically after that.
- **New `Services/UnloadableLogService.cs`** — reflection-based aggregation over
  any record type shaped with `CellDataAndStatus` fields (works for Individual
  today; Business would reuse the same service). Builds the xlsx via ClosedXML.
- Percentage in the rejection tables is **% of UNL records**, not % of the total
  file.
- `Date Emailed` / `Date Fixed` are left blank for manual entry — the automated
  email/reporting framework isn't built into this codebase yet.
- The Demographic/Financial field split is a **best-guess from field order**,
  not yet verified against the BoG field-mapping document from earlier work.
  Correct `DemographicFieldNames` in `UnloadableLogService.cs` if anything's
  misclassified.
- **Known limitation:** generates a single-file workbook for the file just
  processed. Does not read-modify-write an existing master log — copy the row
  in manually for now if you're tracking a running log across files. Storing
  this as a proper database table (instead of a one-off xlsx per run) is
  planned as a future improvement.

*Files:* `ApplicationDbContext.cs`, `DataManagementService.cs`,
`SubScribersDBContext.cs` (new `SubscriberProfile` entity),
`Services/UnloadableLogService.cs` (new), `Home.razor`.

### Clarified — manual-rescue registration workflow
The existing **REFERENCE A FILE** tab (renamed **REFERENCE / REGISTER RECORDS**)
already did what a planned "register manually rescued records" feature was
scoped to do — no new logic was needed, just clarity. Verified the tab's
`DBIndividualContext` read path uses the exact same column layout as the
CLEAN-sheet write path (`AccNum` col 3, `CustomerID` col 4, `CreditFacilityType`
col 69, `DisbursementDate` col 75), so re-uploading a corrected CLEAN sheet —
including manually rescued records an associate added by hand — registers those
records into `IndividualsData` via the existing idempotent upsert.

Added an in-app info alert explaining both use cases (initial reference load +
manual-rescue registration) and flagging the one real constraint: **the
uploaded file's name prefix (before the first `_`) must stay intact**, since
`GetFileShortCodeFromFileName` derives the subscriber code from it.

*Known gap, not addressed:* `IndividualRef` has no provenance field, so a
record registered this way is indistinguishable from one the cleanser matched
automatically. Worth a follow-up if BoG audit trail ever requires knowing *why*
a record is trusted.

*Files:* `Home.razor` (markup/labels only — no logic change).

### Fixed — overdraft disbursement-date false-UNL routing
Two related bugs were causing legitimate overdraft redraws to be wrongly routed
to UNL:

1. **Cross-submission mismatch.** In `REF_MainMatcherTransformerInd_Clean_IND`,
   the reference lookup (`databaseDict`) was keyed by `(AccNum, CustomerID)`
   only — dropping `DisbursementDate` — so a facility's full disbursement-date
   history collapsed to whichever historical row happened to be last inserted.
   A new draw that matched an *earlier* historical date (just not the
   last-surviving one) was wrongly flagged as a mismatch. Fixed by keeping the
   full list of historical dates per facility and checking the incoming date
   against the whole set.
2. **Same-submission duplicates.** `AssignDuplicateDoBIssues` had no
   overdraft-type awareness at all (unlike the sibling duplicate-check block
   right above it), so multiple legitimate overdraft draws in the same file
   were blanket-flagged as `DisbursementDateMisMatch = "UNL"`. Added the same
   `CreditFacilityType == "V"` exemption used elsewhere.

Both fixes are scoped to overdraft facilities specifically — term-loan
mismatches and genuine duplicates are still correctly flagged (verified via a
regression test alongside the fix).

*Files:* `Home.razor` (`REF_MainMatcherTransformerInd_Clean_IND`,
`AssignDuplicateDoBIssues`).
